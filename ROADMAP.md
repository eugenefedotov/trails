# trailmap

## Purpose

The trails.js team maintains this document to serve as a foward-looking plan
for how the framework will grow and evolve. Please submit a Pull Request if you
feel that something should be added or changed in this document, and we are
happy to discuss.

## Organization

Each future *minor* release will be represented by a Github Milestone, which will
be linked to in the following sections. Each future *major* version will contain
one or more minor-release Milestones.

## Release Schedule

Major and minor version releases occur according to a regular calendar
schedule, and versions are assigned according to semver. The preview of
each major release occurs in January of each year; the final major version
GA (General Availability) release occurs in April of each year, coincident with
each [major Node.js release](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-plan). In
October, a minor-version of the April release will be memorialized as an LTS
release.

## Backlog

The backlog consists of features which are not currently in the immediate-term roadmap above, but are useful.  We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the items below, so long as it was accompanied with reasonable tests that prove it, and it doesn't break other core functionality.

This backlog table is intended for major pieces of functionality that have not been broken down yet.  If you have a backlog item that's a smaller piece of work, please add it to the [Backlog](https://github.com/trailsjs/trails/milestones/Backlog) milestone in the Issue queue.
