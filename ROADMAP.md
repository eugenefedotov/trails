# trailmap

## Purpose

The trails.js team maintains this document to serve as a foward-looking plan
for how the framework will grow and evolve. Please submit a Pull Request if you
feel that something should be added or changed in this document, and we are
happy to discuss.

## Organization

Each future *minor* release will be represented by a Github Milestone, which will
be linked to in the following sections. Each future *major* version will contain
one or more minor-release Milestones.

## Release Schedule

Major and minor version releases occur according to a regular calendar
schedule, and versions are assigned according to semver. The beta preview of
each major release occurs in January of each year; the final major version
GA (General Availability) release occurs in April of each year, coincident with
each [major Node.js release](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-plan).
